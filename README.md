=====

"Fork Stork" to create a new MOOSE-based application.

For more information see: [http://mooseframework.com/create-an-app/](http://mooseframework.com/create-an-app/)

First pass effort to create a fixed bed ion exchange column simulator.  First draft will be cation resin/sodium system.  Equilibrium will be ideal mass action.  Flux expressions derived from Franzreb reduction of Nernst Planck.  Ideal solution equilibrium, charge balance.
