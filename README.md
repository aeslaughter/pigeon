XContact is "eXperimental Contact".
It is a collection of kernels and tests for experimentation with different solver techniques for elastic contact problems.
Clone xcontact to a directory 'adjacent' to Moose, and then build it simply as
>make METHOD=dbg
etc.
If Moose is located elsewhere, then build this way:
>MOOSE_DIR=<moose-dir> make METHOD=dbg
etc.
