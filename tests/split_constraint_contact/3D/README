Examples below this directory test the handling of contact between two blocks,
hence the 'B' in Bx_tet.jou and Bx_tet.e and Bx_XXX.i below.
The block meshes are generated using the *.jou files here with Cubit,
but the meshes need to go into the directories specific to the tests: glued, etc.
The easiest way to do it is to run Cubit in the batch mode from subdirectories:
>cd glued
>cubit -batch -nographics ../B3_tet.jou

The interpretation of the results of the tests in the specific directories is
in the README files in those directories.
